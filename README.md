# Bash_Timer (timer.sh)
keep track of time using bash
This script needs a timer.comf file, which is included in the .gitignore file. 
The contents should be as follows:

CAT_HEADING_ARRAY=(
"Some category"
"Project 2"
"Lunch"
"Other"
)

It can currently have up to 17 categories


# Python_Timer (timer.py)
keep track of time using python3
This script needs a timerpy.conf file, which is included in the .gitignore file.
It should contain some lines similar to the following. Note that any line with #
will be ignored, spaces are fine, quotes are not necessary, and the EOL character
should be \n (Unix style) - Maybe I'll make it work with /r/n or /r for Windows 
or Mac later... maybe... 

Also note, the code is written to show eod considering "Lunch," so that category 
is necessary in the current version

# Categories
Some category
Project 2
Lunch
Other
